# CS4ML: A general framework for active learning with arbitrary data based on Christoffel functions 

Christoffel Sampling for Machine Learning is a general framework for active learning in regression problems. It allows the approximation for a target function arising from general types of data, rather than pointwise samples. This generalization covers many cases of practical interest, such as data acquired in transform domains (e.g., Fourier data), vector-valued data (e.g., gradient-augmented data), data acquired along continuous curves, and, multimodal data (i.e., combinations of different types of measurements). 

This library shows the efficacy of our framework for gradient-augmented learning with polynomials, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) using generative models and adaptive sampling for solving PDEs using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). You can use the tools provided in this repository for your own data.

Parts of this repository are based on the code for the paper "CAS4DL: Christoffel Adaptive Sampling for function approximation via Deep Learning" by Ben Adcock, Juan M.

# Code organization 
Files are organized into four main directories:

### src 
Contains the main Matlab files used to create figures in each section

Organized in sections

### utils 
Contains various python functions needed across main scripts

### data 
Contains .mat files generated by scripts in src

Organized in sections

### Filenames

These generaically take the form 

fig_[sec][number]\_[row]_[col]

where [sec] is the section number, [number], [number1] and [number2] are the figure numbers and [row] and [col] are the row number and column number is multi-panel figures.

# Installation and Quick Start 

You can clone the repository and install locally. It is highly recommended to clone in editable mode so the changes are applied without having to reinstall:
 
```
git clone https://github.com/JMcardenas/CS4ML.git
```
Next, run mainiter.py or modify config0.py to your own purposes: 

```
run main_iter.py
```
