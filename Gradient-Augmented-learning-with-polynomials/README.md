# Gradient-Augmented learning with polynomials
Description: 
MATLAB m-files used to generate the polynomial regression example in the paper.

Organization: The code is organized into four folders:
  - data: contains the data generated
  - figs: contains the figures
  - src: main m-files for generating the data and the figures
  - utils: various m-files used to compute the approximations.

# Note: 
The folder utils contains several m-files that have taken (and in some cases, modified in small ways) from the MATLAB code for the book "Sparse Polynomial Approximation of High-Dimensional Functions‚Äù. Originals are available here: www.sparse-hd-book.com. See the description for each file for further information.
